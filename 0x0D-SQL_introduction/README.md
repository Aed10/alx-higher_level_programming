## Description

In this project, we explore the basics of SQL and learn how to perform various operations on databases, such as creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and deleting records. We also cover concepts like database normalization, primary keys, foreign keys, and basic SQL syntax.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of the following:

- What SQL is and its importance in the world of databases
- How to create and manage databases using SQL
- How to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases
- How to write SQL queries to retrieve specific data from databases
- How to use SQL to manipulate and transform data

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- MySQL (or any other relational database management system)

## Files

The project contains the following files:

- `0-list_databases.sql`: A script that lists all databases in the MySQL server.
- `1-create_database_if_missing.sql`: A script that creates a database if it doesn't already exist.
- `2-remove_database.sql`: A script that removes a database from the MySQL server.
- `3-list_tables.sql`: A script that lists all tables in a database.
- `4-first_table.sql`: A script that creates a table in a database.
- `5-full_table.sql`: A script that prints the full description of a table.
- `6-list_values.sql`: A script that lists all rows of a table.
- `7-insert_value.sql`: A script that inserts a new row into a table.
- `8-count_89.sql`: A script that displays the number of records with a specific condition.
- `9-full_creation.sql`: A script that creates a new table and populates it with data.
- `10-top_score.sql`: A script that lists all records with the highest score.
- `11-best_score.sql`: A script that lists all records with the highest score, grouped by a specific column.
- `12-no_cheating.sql`: A script that updates a record in a table.
- `13-change_class.sql`: A script that removes a record from a table.
- `14-average.sql`: A script that computes the average score of a table.
- `15-groups.sql`: A script that lists the number of records in each group of a table.
- `16-no_link.sql`: A script that displays records from two tables without a foreign key relation.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this project, follow these steps:

1. Install a relational database management system (e.g., MySQL).
2. Create a new database.
3. Execute the SQL scripts using a database client or command-line interface.
